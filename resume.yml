objective: |
  Programming is a true passion of mine, so I am interested in opportunities which will nourish my growth. I know how to learn, I know how to implement what I've learned, and I know how to teach what I've implemented. I get excited about solving problems both big and small with the best code I can push myself to write. I appreciate best practices and hold myself to the highest of standards.
